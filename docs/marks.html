		<h2>Marks</h2>
		<p><strong><a href="https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/marks/">Marks</a></strong> visually encode data using geographic primitives. We currently support VEGA's <code><a href="#area">area</a></code>, <code><a href="#line">line</a></code>, <code><a href="#rect">rect</a></code>, <code><a href="#rule">rule</a></code>, <code><a href="#symbol">symbol</a></code>, and <code><a href="#text">text</a></code> marks.</p>
		<h3>Changing styles</h3>
		<p>The marks are styled using three <code>encode</code> options. The initial style is set with <code>enter</code>. The markers are updated with the <code>update</code> option. A hover event triggers a <code>hover</code> and a mouseout then styles the point again using <code>update</code>. It should be noted that to save processing, the <code>hover</code> event actually just draws the styled version of the marker on a separate canvas and draws that <strong>on top</strong> of the existing canvas. This means we can keep a copy of the existing canvas and not have to re-draw everything. The result is that you may be able to see parts of the non-hovered version of the marker depending on how you style the hovered version. This will be more noticeable for <code>text</code> markers.</p>

Setting the z-index as an encoding property only affects ordering among sibling mark items; it will not change the layering relative to other mark definitions. Unlike the mark-level <em>sort</em> property, <em>zindex</em> changes the rendering order only; it does not otherwise change mark item order (such as line or area point order). The most common use of <em>zindex</em> is to ensure that a mark is drawn over its siblings when selected, such as by mouse hover.</td></tr>

Setting the z-index as an encoding property only affects ordering among sibling mark items; it will not change the layering relative to other mark definitions. Unlike the mark-level <em>sort</em> property, <em>zindex</em> changes the rendering order only; it does not otherwise change mark item order (such as line or area point order). The most common use of <em>zindex</em> is to ensure that a mark is drawn over its siblings when selected, such as by mouse hover.</td></tr>

Setting the z-index as an encoding property only affects ordering among sibling mark items; it will not change the layering relative to other mark definitions. Unlike the mark-level <em>sort</em> property, <em>zindex</em> changes the rendering order only; it does not otherwise change mark item order (such as line or area point order). The most common use of <em>zindex</em> is to ensure that a mark is drawn over its siblings when selected, such as by mouse hover.</td></tr>
