Setting the z-index as an encoding property only affects ordering among sibling mark items; it will not change the layering relative to other mark definitions. Unlike the mark-level <em>sort</em> property, <em>zindex</em> changes the rendering order only; it does not otherwise change mark item order (such as line or area point order). The most common use of <em>zindex</em> is to ensure that a mark is drawn over its siblings when selected, such as by mouse hover.</td>

					<p>The VEGA implementation allows a <code>defined</code> flag to say if a data point is defined. If <code>false</code>, the corresponding line segment will be omitted creating a "break".

Setting the z-index as an encoding property only affects ordering among sibling mark items; it will not change the layering relative to other mark definitions. Unlike the mark-level <em>sort</em> property, <em>zindex</em> changes the rendering order only; it does not otherwise change mark item order (such as line or area point order). The most common use of <em>zindex</em> is to ensure that a mark is drawn over its siblings when selected, such as by mouse hover.</td>

					<h2>Rect</h2>
					<p>Rect marks are rectangles with a given position, width and height. They are useful for drawing error bars behind data points. See <a href="#rect-mark-properties">which VEGA properties are supported</a> below.</p>
					<p>The VEGA implementation allows a <code>defined</code> flag to say if a data point is defined. If <code>false</code>, the corresponding line segment will be omitted creating a "break". Our implementation allows breaks to be included my inserting undefined values in the data. The following example includes a line with a break and hover events.</p>

Setting the z-index as an encoding property only affects ordering among sibling mark items; it will not change the layering relative to other mark definitions. Unlike the mark-level <em>sort</em> property, <em>zindex</em> changes the rendering order only; it does not otherwise change mark item order (such as line or area point order). The most common use of <em>zindex</em> is to ensure that a mark is drawn over its siblings when selected, such as by mouse hover.</td>

Higher values (<code class="highlighter-rouge">1</code>) will cause marks to be drawn on top of those with lower z-index values. Setting the z-index as an encoding property only affects ordering among sibling mark items; it will not change the layering relative to other mark definitions. Unlike the mark-level <em>sort</em> property, <em>zindex</em> changes the rendering order only; it does not otherwise change mark item order (such as line or area point order). The most common use of <em>zindex</em> is to ensure that a mark is drawn over its siblings when selected, such as by mouse hover.</td>

Higher values (<code class="highlighter-rouge">1</code>) will cause marks to be drawn on top of those with lower z-index values. Setting the z-index as an encoding property only affects ordering among sibling mark items; it will not change the layering relative to other mark definitions. Unlike the mark-level <em>sort</em> property, <em>zindex</em> changes the rendering order only; it does not otherwise change mark item order (such as line or area point order). The most common use of <em>zindex</em> is to ensure that a mark is drawn over its siblings when selected, such as by mouse hover.</td>
