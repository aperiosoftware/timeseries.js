The default value is <code class="highlighter-rouge">0</code>. Higher values (<code class="highlighter-rouge">1</code>) will cause marks to be drawn on top of those with lower z-index values. Setting the z-index as an encoding property only affects ordering among sibling mark items; it will not change the layering relative to other mark definitions. Unlike the mark-level <em>sort</em> property, <em>zindex</em> changes the rendering order only; it does not otherwise change mark item order (such as line or area point order). The most common use of <em>zindex</em> is to ensure that a mark is drawn over its siblings when selected, such as by mouse hover.</td></tr>
